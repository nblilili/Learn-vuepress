## Video Data Collection Management

### Set the type of camera to turn on

Before video capture settings, you can get the camera list, current
camera, and default camera through the properties and methods in the
JCMediaDevice class, as follows:

``````cpp
std::list<JCMediaDeviceCamera>* cameras = JCManager::shared()->mediaDevice->getCameras();
``````

After obtaining the Camera list, call the
[switchCamera](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_media_device.html#a0716deb7c816c605444f2bb3202e9ef5)
method to switch the specified camera:

``````cpp
/// Switch the specified camera
JCManager::shared()->mediaDevice->switchCamera(cameras[0]);
``````

### Set camera capture resolution

Call the
[setCameraProperty](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_media_device.html#a2ec180f6fc51367007b854dd0bc2866b)
interface to customize the capture parameters of the camera, such as the
height, width and frame rate of the capture, to achieve different
capture resolutions.

``````cpp
JCManager::shared()->mediaDevice->setCameraProperty(640, 360, 24);
``````

### Set canvas rotation angle

Call the
[rotate](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_media_device_video_canvas.html#a44d1073788a9cd3c6620c839eea76ffa)
interface to set the rotation angle of the canvas in the Canvas. Among
them, the rotation angle must be a multiple of 90, which represents the
angle after rotating with the screen in the positive direction.

``````cpp
JCManager::shared()->mediaDeviceCanvas->rotate(Angle90);
``````

After calling this interface, the local video image and remote video
image displayed on the local end will rotate at the same angle at the
same time, and the image displayed on the receiver will not be affected.

For example, if A is set to rotate 90 degrees, the A and B video images
displayed on the A side will rotate 90 degrees at the same time. The
video image on the B side will not change. As shown below:

![../../../../\_images/rotateset.png](../../../../_images/rotateset.png)

The angle reference is as follows:

``````cpp
// Window and screen angle 0
Angle0 = 0,
// Window and screen angle 90
Angle90 = 90,
// Window and screen angle 180
Angle180 = 180,
// Window and screen angle 270
Angle270 = 270
``````

## Video data collection management

### Raw video data

In the process of video transmission, you can perform image processing
on each frame of video data to achieve beauty mode and other needs.
There are two processingcircumstances:

1. Process before pre-encoding and after video capture which affects
    local preview and peer receiving video.

2. Process after decoding and before rendering which affects the local
    video reception.

Details are as follows:

**Process after video capture and before pre-coding**

Refer to the following steps to implement the original video data
function in your project:

1. Register the video capture callback through
    Zmf\_VideoCaptureAddCallback before initiating the service, and
    implement a callback function of type ZmfVideoCaptureCallback in
    this function;

2. After successful registration, the JC SDK will call back the
    corresponding parameters of the original video data collected
    through the callback function when each video frame is captured;

3. After the user gets the video data, he/she performs parameter
    processing in the callback function according to the needs of the
    scene, and the processed data is returned to the JC SDK through the
    callback function.

Register the video capture callback at first, which can be called after
successful login:

``````cpp
/** add capture data callback
 * @param[in] pUser     the callback user data
 * @param[in] pfnCb     the callback
 * returns 0 on succeed, otherwise failed
 */
int Zmf_VideoCaptureAddCallback (void *pUser, ZmfVideoCaptureCallback pfnCb)
``````

Callback type description:

``````cpp
/** the callback to receive captured image
 * iImgAngle - iCamOrient equal to device rotate angle.
 * if encoder is NULL, the pixel format of buf must be ZmfPixelFormatI420
 *
 * @param[in] pUser     the user data registered by Zmf_VideoCaptureAddCallback
 * @param[in] captureId the id of captured image
 * @param[in] iFace     the capture Face @see ZmfVideoFaceType
 * @param[in] iImgAngle the image rotated angle (CW)
 * @param[in] iCaptureOrient the capturer fixed orient
 * @param[in,out] iWidth  the image width
 * @param[in,out] iHeight the image height
 * @param[in,out] buf     the image data I420 buffer
 * @param[in,out] encoder capture encoder
 */
 typedef void (*ZmfVideoCaptureCallback)(void* pUser, const char* captureId, int iFace,
                                       int iImgAngle, int iCaptureOrient, int* iWidth, int* iHeight,
                                       unsigned char *buf, ZmfVideoCaptureEncoder* encoder);
``````

Sample code:

``````cpp
static void zmfVideoCaptureCallback(void* pUser, const char* captureId, int iFace,
                                    int iImgAngle, int iCaptureOrient, int* iWidth, int* iHeight,
                                    unsigned char *buf, ZmfVideoCaptureEncoder* encoder) {

    cout << "Video data processing" << endl;
}
void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonCall()
{
    //Register callback
    Zmf_VideoCaptureAddCallback(void*pUser, zmfVideoCaptureCallback);
    //Initiate the call
    ...
}
``````

After registration, the video data collected in each frame can be
processed through the ZmfVideoCaptureCallback callback, and the
corresponding video data can be processed.

If you want to remove the callback, call the following interface:

``````cpp
```
 /** remove capture data callback
  * @param[in] pUser     the callback user data
  * returns 0 on succeed, otherwise failed
  */
int Zmf_VideoCaptureRemoveCallback (void *pUser)
```
``````

Sample code:

``````cpp
void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonEndCall()
{
    //Remove the callback
    Zmf_VideoCaptureRemoveCallback(p);
    //Hang up the call
    ...
}
``````

**Process after decoding and before pre-rendering**

Refer to the following steps to implement the original video data
function in your project:

1. Register the video capture callback through
    Zmf\_VideoCaptureAddCallback before initiating the service, and
    implement a callback function of type ZmfVideoCaptureCallback in
    this function

2. After successful registration, the JC SDK will call back the
    corresponding parameters of the original video data collected
    through the callback function when each video frame is captured

3. After the user gets the video data, he/she performs parameter
    processing in the callback function according to the needs of the
    scene, and the processed data is returned to the JC SDK through the
    callback function.

Register the video capture callback at first, which can be called after
successful login:

``````cpp
/**
 * add render data callback
 *
 * @param[in] pUser      the callback user data
 * @param[in] pfnCb      the callback
 *
 * @return               0 on succeed, otherwise failed.
 */
int Zmf_VideoRenderAddCallback (void *pUser, ZmfVideoRenderCallback pfnCb);
``````

Callback type description:

``````cpp
/**
 * The callback to receive video render data
 *
 * @param[in] pUser         the user data registered by Zmf_AddVideoRenderCallback
 * @param[in] renderId      video render unique name
 * @param[in] sourceType    video render source type @see ZmfVideoSourceType
 * @param[in] iAngle the image angle
 * @param[in] iMirror the image mirror type
 * @param[in] iWidth  the image width
 * @param[in] iHeight  the image height
 * @param[in] buf           I420 render data
 *
 * @return                  if process render data should return > 0, other 0
 *
 * @remarks
 *  if buf == 0 or iWidth ==0 or iHeight == 0, means the render will close,
 *  so should call Zmf_OnVideoRenderRequestRemove.
 */
 typedef int  (*ZmfVideoRenderCallback)(void* pUser, const char* renderId, int sourceType, int iAngle,
                                  int iMirror, int* iWidth, int* iHeight, unsigned char *buf,
                                  unsigned long timeStamp);
``````

After registration, the video data collected in each frame can be
processed through the ZmfVideoCaptureCallback callback, and the
corresponding video data can be processed.

Sample code:

``````cpp
static void zmfVideoRenderCallback(void* pUser, const char* renderId, int sourceType, int iAngle,
                                   int iMirror, int* iWidth, int* iHeight, unsigned char *buf,
                                   unsigned long timeStamp) {

   cout << "Video data processing" << endl;
}
void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonCall()
{
    //Register callback
    Zmf_VideoRenderAddCallback(void*pUser, zmfVideoRenderCallback);
    //Initiate the call
    ...
}
``````

If you want to remove the callback, call the following interface:

``````cpp
/**
 * remove render data callback
 *
 * @param[in] pUser      the callback user data
 * @return               0 on succeed, otherwise failed.
 */
int Zmf_VideoRenderRemoveCallback (void *pUser)
``````

Sample code:

``````cpp
void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonEndCall()
{
    //Remove the callback
    Zmf_VideoRenderRemoveCallback(p);
    //Hang up the call
    ...
}
``````

### Custom video capture and rendering

For video capture/rendering devices that do not support the systemâ€™s
standard APIs, or if you want to use the already collected I420 or h264
data, you can start a separate capture/rendering thread and put the
capture/rendering data into the corresponding interface of Juphoon for
subsequent operations.

Refer to the following steps to implement the custom video source
function in your project:

1. Input the data collected/ready to be rendered by the external device
    to the JC SDK through the interface provided by the JC SDK for
    subsequent operations.

2. If you want to stop the data input collected/ready to be rendered by
    the external device, you can call the interface provided by the JC
    SDK to stop the data input.

The custom video capture interface is as follows:

After receiving the callback for successful login and after
Zmf\_VideoInitialize is initialized successfully, input the data
collected/ready for rendering through the following interface

``````cpp
/**
 * The video capture data entry to ZMF
 * iImgAngle - iCamOrient equal to device rotate angle.
 * if encoder is NULL, the pixel format of bufI420 must be ZmfPixelFormatI420
 *
 * @param[in] captureId     unique name of the video capture           //Identify the external ID
 * @param[in] iFace         the capture face, @see ZmfVideoFaceType    //The orientation of the external video, generally 0
 * @param[in] iImgAngle     the image rotated angle (CW)               // The rotation angle required for the input external video to stand upright, clockwise is positive, and the value range is 0, 90, 180, 270
 * @param[in] iCamAngle     the camera fixed orient                    //External camera fixed angle, same as iImgAngle, value range 0, 90, 180, 270
 * @param[in,out] iWidth    the image width at least align 4,
 *                          return the cropped width of bufI420.       //Input the width of the image
 * @param[in,out] iHeight   the image height at least align 4.
 *                          return the cropped height of bufI420.      //Input the height of the input image
 * @param[in] bufI420       the image data                             //Input the buffer of the input image
 * @param[in,out] encoder   the capture encoder                        //Identify the encoding format of the input image
 */
 void Zmf_OnVideoCapture(const char *captureId, int iFace, int iImgAngle, int iCamAngle, int *iWidth, int *iHeight, unsigned char *bufI420, ZmfVideoCaptureEncoder* encoder);
``````

Sample code:

``````cpp
Zmf_VideoInitialize(NULL);
void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonCall()
{
    //The input resolution of the image is 640*360 with I420 code, without additional rotation
    Zmf_OnVideoCapture("Test",0,0,0,640,360,buf,0);
    //Initiate the call
    ...
}
``````

Collection stop interface:

``````cpp
/**
 * tell ZMF the video capture has stopped
 *
 * @param[in] captureId     unique name of the device
 */
void Zmf_OnVideoCaptureDidStop(const char *captureId);
``````

Sample code:

``````cpp
void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonEndCall()
{
    //Stop collection
    Zmf_OnVideoCaptureDidStop("Test");
    //Hang up the call
    ...
}
``````

If you want to use your own rendering method on the video rendering
side, call the following interface:

Video data rendering interface:

``````cpp
/**
 * The video render data entry to ZMF
 *
 * @param[in] renderId      unique name of the video render source                //Identify the rendering ID
 * @param[in] sourceType    the render source type, @see ZmfVideoSourceType       //Render source type, generally 0
 * @param[in] iAngle        the image rotated angle (CW)ZmfVideoCaptureCallback   //The angle required for rendering upright, generally 0, value range 0, 90, 180, 270
 * @param[in] iMirror       the camera fixed orient                               //default 0
 * @param[in] iWidth        the image width                                       //Render image width
 * @param[in] iHeight       the image height                                      //Render image height
 * @param[in] bufI420       the image data I420 buffer                            //Renderibg data buffer
 */
 void Zmf_OnVideoRender(const char *renderId, int sourceType, int iAngle, int iMirror, int *iWidth, int *iHeight, unsigned char *bufI420, unsigned long timeStamp);
``````

Sample code:

``````cpp
Zmf_VideoInitialize(NULL);
void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonCall()
{
    //The input resolution of the image is 640*360 with I420 code, without additional rotation
    Zmf_OnVideoRender("Test",0,0,0,640,360,buf,0);
    //Initiate the call
    ...
}
``````

Render data stop interface:

``````cpp
Zmf_OnVideoRender(const char *renderId, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
``````

Sample code:

``````cpp
void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonEndCall()
{
    //Stop rendering
    Zmf_OnVideoRender("Test", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    //Hang up the call
    ...
}
``````
