# Realize Group Calling

This guide introduces how to implement group video calling. The API call
sequence of group video calling is shown in the figure below:

![../../../../\_images/multivideoworkflow.png](../../../../_images/multivideoworkflow.png)

## Initialize

Call [JCMediaDevice
create](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaDevice.html#//api/name/create:callback:)
and [JCCall
create](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCCall.html#//api/name/create:mediaDevice:callback:)
to Initialize modules needed to implement group calls:

``````objectivec
//Initialize
-(bool)initialize {
   //1. Media class
   JCMediaDevice *mediaDevice = [JCMediaDevice create:client callback:self];
   //2. Media channel lass
   JCMediaChannel *mediaChannel = [JCMediaChannel create:client mediaDevice:mediaDevice callback:self];
   return client.state == JCClientStateLogined;
}
``````

Among them:

- The callback in the JCMediaDevice create is the proxy object of the
    [JCMediaDeviceCallback](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Protocols/JCMediaDeviceCallback.html)
    protocol, which is used to notify the upper layer of media device
    related events. Therefore, you need to specify the proxy object of
    callback first, and then implement the JCMediaDeviceCallback in the
    proxy object.

The main methods in the JCMediaDeviceCallback are as follows:

``````objectivec
//Camera changes
-(void)onCameraUpdate;

//Audio output changes
-(void)onAudioOutputTypeChange:(NSString*)audioOutputType;

//Sound interruption recovery
-(void)onAudioInerruptAndResume:(BOOL)interrupt;

//Receive the first frame of video data
-(void)onRenderReceived:(JCMediaDeviceVideoCanvas*)canvas;

//Render start
-(void)onRenderStart:(JCMediaDeviceVideoCanvas*)canvas;
``````

- The callback in the JCMediaChannel create method is the proxy object
    of the
    [JCMediaChannelCallback](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Protocols/JCMediaChannelCallback.html)
    protocol, which is used to notify the relevant events in the channel
    to the upper layer. Therefore, you need to specify the proxy object
    of the callback first, and then implement the JCMediaChannelCallback
    method in the proxy object.

The main methods in JCMediaChannel are as follows:

``````objectivec
//The callback of MediaChannel state change
-(void)onMediaChannelStateChange:(JCMediaChannelState)state oldState:(JCMediaChannelState)oldState;

//The callback of joining ChannelReason
-(void)onJoin:(bool)result reason:(JCMediaChannelReason)reason channelId:(NSString*)channelId;

//The callback of leaving the ChannelReason
-(void)onLeave:(JCMediaChannelReason)reason channelId:(NSString*)channelId;

//The callback of channel Stop result
-(void)onStop:(bool)result reason:(JCMediaChannelReason)reason;

//The callback of ParticipantJoin
-(void)onParticipantJoin:(JCMediaChannelParticipant*)participant;

//The callback of ParticipantLeft
-(void)onParticipantLeft:(JCMediaChannelParticipant*)participant;

//The callback of ParticipantUpdate
-(void)onParticipantUpdate:(JCMediaChannelParticipant*)participant participantChangeParam:(JCMediaChannelParticipantChangeParam *)participantChangeParam;

//The volume change of participants
-(void)onParticipantVolumeChange:(JCMediaChannelParticipant*)participant;
``````

## Join a channel

1. Call
    [enableUploadAudioStream](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannel.html#//api/name/enableUploadAudioStream:)
    to enable the audio stream:

    ``````objectivec
    // 1. Enable the audio stream
    [mediaDeviceChannel enableUploadAudioStream:true];
    // 2. Turn on the video stream
    [mediaDeviceChannel enableUploadVIdeoStream:true];
    ``````

2. Call the
    [join](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannel.html#//api/name/join:joinParam:)
    method to join the channel. You need to pass in the following
    parameters in this method:

      - channelIdOrUri: Channel ID or channel Uri. When uriMode in
        param is set to true, it means channel Uri, and others mean
        channel ID. Users with the same channel ID or Uri will enter
        the same channel.

      - joinParam, fill in nil if no. See
        [JCMediaChannelJoinParam](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannelJoinParam.html)
        object for details.

    ``````objectivec
    // Join a channel
    [mediaChannel join:@"222" joinParam:nil];
    ``````

3. The
    [onJoin](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Protocols/JCMediaChannelCallback.html#//api/name/onJoin:reason:channelId:)
    callback triggers after joining the channel:

    ``````objectivec
    // The callback of joining ChannelReason
    -(void)onJoin:(bool)result reason:(JCMediaChannelReason)reason channelId:(NSString*)channelId
    {
        if (result) {
          // Successfully joined
        } else {
          // Failed to join
        }
    }
    ``````

## Create local video images

1. After joining the channel, obtain the self object in the channel
    through the selfParticipant attribute in
    [JCMediaChannel](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannel.html):

    ``````objectivec
    // 1. Access the memeber objects in the channel
    JCMediaChannelParticipant *participant = mediaChannel.selfParticipant;
    ``````

2. Call the
    [startVideo](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaDevice.html#//api/name/startVideo:renderType:)
    method in the
    [JCMediaChannelParticipant](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannelParticipant.html)
    class to open the local video preview. This method returns a
    [JCMediaDeviceVideoCanvas](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaDeviceVideoCanvas.html)
    object, which is used to render the video to the canvas and manage
    the rendering method. (Calling this method will open the camera):

    ``````objectivec
    // 2. Open local video preview
    JCMediaDeviceVideoCanvas *localCanvas = [participant startVideo:JCMediaDeviceRenderFullScreen pictureSize:JCMediaChannelPictureSizeLarge];
    ``````

## Create remote video images

During a video call, you usually need to see other users. After the
remote user successfully joins the channel, the
[onParticipantJoin](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Protocols/JCMediaChannelCallback.html#//api/name/onParticipantJoin:)
callback will be triggered, which contains the object of the remote
user.

In this callback, call the
[startVideo](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaDevice.html#//api/name/startVideo:renderType:)
method in the
[JCMediaChannelParticipant](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannelParticipant.html)
class to set the remote userâ€™s view. Calling this method will return a
[JCMediaDeviceVideoCanvas](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaDeviceVideoCanvas.html)
object, which is used to render the video to the canvas and manage the
rendering method:

``````objectivec
-(void)onParticipantJoin:(JCMediaChannelParticipant*)participant {
    if (participant.video) {
        JCMediaDeviceVideoCanvas *remoteCanvas = [participant startVideo:JCMediaDeviceRenderFullScreen pictureSize:JCMediaChannelPictureSizeLarge];
    }
}
``````

More Steps

- Upload a local audio stream

Since the SDK does not upload local audio streams by default, other
members will not be able to hear your voice.If you want other members in
the channel to hear your voice, you need to call the
[enableUploadAudioStream](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannel.html#//api/name/enableUploadAudioStream:)
method in
[JCMediaChannel](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannel.html)
to upload the local audio stream:

``````objectivec
// Send a local audio stream
[mediaChannel enableUploadAudioStream:true];
``````

## Leave a channel

Call the
[leave](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannel.html#//api/name/leave)
method to leave the current channel:

``````objectivec
[mediaChannel leave];
``````

After leaving the channel, they receive the
[onLeave](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Protocols/JCMediaChannelCallback.html#//api/name/onLeave:channelId:)
callback, and other members receive the
[onParticipantLeft](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Protocols/JCMediaChannelCallback.html#//api/name/onParticipantLeft:)
callback at the same time.

## Destroy local and remote video images

After the video is hung up, call
[stopVideo](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaDevice.html#//api/name/stopVideo:)
in the
[JCMediaChannelParticipant](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannelParticipant.html)
to destroy local and remote video images:

``````objectivec
-(void)onLeave:(JCMediaChannelReason)reason channelId:(NSString*)channelId {
    if (localCanvas != nil) { // Destroy local video images
        [participant stopVideo];
    }
    if (remoteCanvas != nil) { // Remote video destruction
        [participant stopVideo];
    }
}
``````

## Destroy a channel

If you want to destroy a channel, you can call the following interface,
and all members will be quit:

``````objectivec
// End a channel
[mediaChannel stop];
``````

After the channel is stopped, the member that initiated the termination
receives the
[onStop](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Protocols/JCMediaChannelCallback.html#//api/name/onStop:reason:)
callback, and other members receive the
[onLeave](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Protocols/JCMediaChannelCallback.html#//api/name/onLeave:channelId:)
callback at the same time. Please refer to
[JCMediaChannelReason](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Constants/JCMediaChannelReason.html)
for the enumeration value of the reason for failure.

After stopped the channel, you also need to Call
[stopVideo](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaDevice.html#//api/name/stopVideo:)
in the
[JCMediaChannelParticipant](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/ios/Classes/JCMediaChannelParticipant.html)
to destroy local and remote video images.
