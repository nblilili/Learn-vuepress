# Realize One-to-One Voice Calling

This guide introduces how to implement one-to-one voice calling. The API
call sequence of one-to-one calls is shown in the figure below:

![../../../../\_images/1-1workflowios.png](../../../../_images/1-1workflowios.png)

## Initialize

Extend the
[JCMediaDeviceCallback](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_media_device_callback.html)
object and
[JCCallCallback](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call_callback.html)
object, and implement the pure virtual functions in these two objects:

``````cpp
class JCManager : public JCMediaDeviceCallback, public JCCallCallback
{
public:
    //This callback triggers when the callItem is added
    virtual void onCallItemAdd(JCCallItem* item);
    //This callback triggers when the callItem is removed
    virtual void onCallItemRemove(JCCallItem* item, JCCallReason reason, const char* description);
    //This callback triggers when the callItemâ€˜s status is updated
    virtual void onCallItemUpdate(JCCallItem* item, JCCallItemChangeParam changeParam);
    //This callback triggers when messages are received
    virtual void onMessageReceive(const char* type, const char* content, JCCallItem* item);
    //This callback triggers when get missed calls
    virtual void onMissedCallItem(JCCallItem* item);
    //This callback triggers when the camera is switched
    virtual void onCameraUpdate();

public:
    //JCClient object
    JCMediaDevice* mediaDevice;
    //JCCall object
    JCCall* call;
};
``````

::: tip

The object in the callback can only be used in the callback and cannot
be saved. The upper layer can obtain the call object through the
corresponding method.

:::

Call
[createJCMediaDevice](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/_j_c_media_device_8h.html#a96a10766264f3c12af531b70cb9c9749)
and
[createJCCall](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/_j_c_call_8h.html#a29320972a659ce8eaf4994576103a62c)
to initialize the modules needed for one-to-one calling:

``````cpp
bool JCManager::initialize()
{
    //1. Media class
    mediaDevice = createJCMediaDevice(client, this);
    //2. Call class
    call = createJCCall(client, mediaDevice, this);
    return true;
}
``````

Among them:

- This in the JCMediaDevice create method is a derived class of
    [JCMediaDeviceCallback](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_media_device_callback.html)
    , which is used to notify the upper layer of media device-related
    events. Therefore, you need to create a derived class of
    JCMediaDeviceCallback, and then implement the pure virtual function
    of JCMediaDeviceCallback in the derived class.

- This in the JCCall create method is a derived class of
    [JCCallCallback](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call_callback.html),
    which is used to notify call-related events to the upper layer.
    Therefore, you need to create a derived class of JCCallback, and
    then implement the pure virtual function of JCCallCallback in the
    derived class.

## Make a call

Call
[call](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call.html#a7b2d614431cb23e82ea18b77deb50549)
to initiate a video call, the parameters that need to be filled are:

- `userID` Fill in the user ID of the other party.

- `video` Select whether to call a video call, and true means to make
    a video call, while false means to make a voice call.

- `extraParam` is a custom pass-through string, which can be obtained
    through the extraParam property in the JCCallItem object.

``````cpp
// Initiate a voice call
void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonVoicecall()
{
    JCManager::shared()->call->call("userID", false, "custom pass-through string");
}
``````

After making a call, both the caller and the called party will receive
the callback
[onCallItemAdd](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call_callback.html#a2188f777767ca071c145d4a50687ce63)
for the new call, and the call state will change to JCCallStatePending.
You can implement the
[onCallItemAdd](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call_callback.html#a2188f777767ca071c145d4a50687ce63)
method in the upper layer and process related logic:

``````cpp
// Receive a new call callback
void JCManager::onCallItemAdd(JCCallItem* item) {
    // Business logic
    if (item->direction == JCCallDirectionIn) {
        // If it is an incoming call
        ...
    } else {
        // If it is an outgoing call
        ...
    }
}
``````

::: tip

If the caller wants to cancel the call, he/she can go directly to the
hang up part. After calling the hang up interface, the call status
becomes the JCCallStateCancel.

:::

## Answer the call

1. After the caller initiates the call successfully, the called party
    will receive the
    [onCallItemAdd](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call_callback.html#a2188f777767ca071c145d4a50687ce63)
    callback. At this time, the getVideo() method and getDirection()
    method in the
    [JCCallItem](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call_item.html)
    object in the callback can be used to determine whether it is a
    video call or a voice call. Thus you can deal with it accordingly:

    ``````cpp
    void JCManager::onCallItemAdd(JCCallItem* item) {
        // 1. If it is an incoming call and is ringing
        if (item->getDirection() == JCCallDirectionIn && item->getState() == JCCallStatePending) {
            // 2. Make corresponding processing, such as "ringing" on the interface
            ...
        }
    }
    ``````

<!-- end list -->

2. Call
    [answer](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call.html#a8e44cef3051dba33a600042c7a5bf987)
    to answer the call, **voice call can only be answered by voice**:

    ``````cpp
    // Get active calls
    JCCallItem* item = JCManager::shared()->call->getActiveCallItem();
    // Answer the call
    JCManager::shared()->call->answer(item, item->getVideo());
    ``````

After the call is answered, the call status changes to
JCCallStateConnecting.

::: tip

If you want to reject the call at this time, you can go directly to the
hang up part. After calling the hang up interface, the call state
becomes JCCallStateCanceled.

:::

## Hang up the call

Both the calling party and the called party can hang up the call.

1. First call
    [getActiveCallItem](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call.html#a4b5e8afc43bd12f877e37a97fec2ff7a)
    to get the currently active call object;

2. After obtaining the current active call object, call
    [term](https://developer.juphoon.com/portal/reference/V2.1/windows/C++/html/class_j_c_call.html#a168fd884512bfd5451ffa5fac83c598b)
    to hang up the current active call:

    ``````cpp
    void JCSampleDlg::OnBnClickedButtonTermcall()
    {
        // 1. Get the current active call
        JCCallItem* item = JCManager::shared()->call->getActiveCallItem();
        if (item != NULL)
        {
        // 2. Hang up the current active call
        JCManager::shared()->call->term(item, JCCallReasonNone, "term");
        }
    }
    ``````

Now, you have completed the basic fucntion of one-to-one voice calling.
